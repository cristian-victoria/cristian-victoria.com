        <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>
        <!--
        <br><h3>Appreciation for life</h3>
        <p>Everything in this world, tangible and intangible, are pieces of a puzzle that is life. In Hindu cultures, 
            it is believed that we are all made up of the same matter — just as clay can have different forms, our bodies and physical 
            surroundings are too a product of the same material but in different shapes and sizes. I believe this definition can extend 
            far beyond the edges of the universe, not just here on earth. In that case, there is to be an appreciation to be had of everything and everyone as one.</p>

        <br><h3>Student of the World</h3>
        <p>In an age marked by artificial intelligence and unimaginable technological innovation in the pursuit for ultimate comfort and convenince, we can 
            forget to uphold our duty as conscious beings to be curious, something we owe to the countless lives before us whose curiosity got us to where we are now, whose curiosity paved the way for 
            incredible strides in scientific discovery and philosophical discussion that have provided our generation with 
            the luxury of civility and peace between nations unlike never seen before. There is so much yet to be done; diseases to find cures for, infrastructures and institutions to be placed to aid world hunger, poverty, and climate change. 
            There is so much of the world yet to be tasted, and yet we conform to the societal pressure of letting these technologies essentially take control of our daily lives and dim this curious spark inside all of us for a quick taste of dopamine.</p>

        <br><h3>Seeker of spiritual truth</h3>
        <p>One's spiritual journey lasts them an entire lifetime. In my lifetime I do not think that I will ever obtain the answer to the most existencial 
            question that persists in this word — why are we all here, now, alive and present at this exact moment in time? Even if I get close to 
            the answer, a part of me believes that I will never be able to fully comprehend the true answer to this question as it exists in a realm 
            far beyond our physical bodies and consciousness can ever reach. But this will not stop me from asking questions. If we as a conscious species are to have purpose, or a responsibility -in other words- it is this... moral enlightenment.</p>
