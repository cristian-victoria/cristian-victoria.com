    <main>
        <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>

        <br><h3>Appreciation for life</h3>
        <p>Everything in this world, whether tangible or intangible, are all pieces of the puzzle that is life. In Hindu cultures, 
            it is believed that we are all made up of the same thing — just as clay can have different forms, our bodies and physical 
            surroundings are too a product of the same material but in different shapes and sizes. I believe this definition can extend 
            far beyond the edges of the universe. In that case, there is to be an appreciation to be had of everything and everyone as equals.</p>

        <br><h3>Student of the World</h3>
        <p>In an age marked by advancing technology and artificial intelligence in the pursuit for ultimate comfort and convenince, we can 
            forget to uphold our humanly duty to be curious as we owe it to the countless lives before us whose curiosity paved the way for 
            incredible strides in scientific discovery and philosophical discussion that, as a cumulative, have provided our generation with 
            the luxury of civility and peace between nations unlike never seen before. There is so much to the world yet to be explored, 
            diseases to be found a cure, infrastructures and institutions to be placed to solve world hunger, poverty, and climate change. 
            There is so much of the world yet to be loved and appreciated, and yet we conform to the societal pressure of letting these technologies 
            take control of our daily lives and dim the light inside of us.</p>

        <br><h3>Seeker of spiritual truth</h3>
        <p>My spiritual journey is one that will last me a lifetime. I do not think that I will ever be able to obtain the answer to the existencial 
            question that persists in this word — why are we all here, now, alive and present at this exact moment in time? Even if I get close to 
            the answer, a part of me believes that I will never be able to fully comprehend the true answer to this question as it exists in a realm 
            far beyond our physical bodies can ever reach. But this will not stop me, or neither should it stop anyone from embarking on their own 
            spiritual journeys. If we as a conscious species are to have purpose, or a responsibility in other words, it is this. This is our ultimate 
            contribution to the world and one we should not be afraid of embarking in.</p>
