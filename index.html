    <main>
        <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>
<!--
        <p><br>There is one thing I often see overlooked by many people, myself included, that plays a central role in all of our lives: luck.

<br><br>The power of belief and hard work is real, and each of us has the ability to influence our own path. Still, we don’t choose the circumstances we are born into. I believe the greatest stroke of luck any of us receives is the country in which we’re born.

<br><br>As Veritasium puts it, <i>“Around half the variance in income received by people around the world is explained by their country of residence and that country’s income distribution.”</i>

<br><br>Part of growing up is learning to live with the circumstances we’re given and, over time, making independent decisions that help steer our lives in the direction we want. Even then, we’re constantly shaped by events beyond our control, like the COVID pandemic, that can change everything in an instant.

<br><br>I consider myself incredibly lucky. I’ve had the opportunity to travel the world at a young age, experiencing different cultures firsthand while discovering who I am and the kind of person I want to be. I’ve never thought of one place as home; instead, I’ve always felt a sense of belonging to the world as a whole.

<br><br>Since then, my goal has been to pay this forward, to do what I can to increase the luck of others. As I reach the end of my college journey and step into the next stage of my life, I’ll continue to work hard toward my goals, while remembering to pause, take a deep breath, and appreciate just how extraordinary the world truly is.</p>
